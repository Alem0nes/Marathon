                <p class="event__description--details">There are enormous health benefits to participating in and training for the Irish Life Dublin Marathon and the Irish Life Race Series. However, it is also a huge physical challenge, which requires a sensible and safe approach. It is essential that you are properly prepared and that you follow a carefully structured training programme that will help you complete each of the race series and also the marathon (if you are taking part) while also safeguarding your health.</br>
                    We advise that you do not participate on any race day unless you have achieved the recommended mileage in your training runs and urge you to take the time to understand issues surrounding hydration, fuel and any medications you might be taking.</p>
